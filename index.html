        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Today we will be looking at a behavioral pattern:Memento Design Pattern.Memento pattern is a behavioral
            design pattern. Memento pattern is used to restore state of an object to a previous state. As your
            application is progressing, you may want to save checkpoints in your application and restore back to those
            checkpoints later.Memento let's us do exactly that.

        <h3>Memento Design Pattern</h3>
        <p><em>The Rationale</em></p>
        <p>Intent of Memento Design pattern is without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object’s
            internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.</p>
        <p>
            The Memento pattern delegates creating the state snapshots to the actual owner of that state, the originator
            object. Hence, instead of other objects trying to copy the editor’s state from the “outside,” the editor
            class itself can make the snapshot since it has full access to its own state.

            The pattern suggests storing the copy of the object’s state in a special object called memento. The contents
            of the memento aren’t accessible to any other object except the one that produced it. Other objects must
            communicate with mementos using a limited interface which may allow fetching the snapshot’s metadata
            (creation time, the name of the performed operation, etc.), but not the original object’s state contained in
            the snapshot.


        </p>
        <p><em>The UML</em></p>
        <p>
            Here is the UML for Memento Design Pattern:
        </p>
        <img src="Memento-Diagram.png" />
        <p>Here are the components of memento design pattern</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>originator :</strong>the object for which the state is to be saved. It creates the memento
                    and uses it in future to undo.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>memento :</strong>the object that is going to maintain the state of originator. Its just a
                    POJO.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>caretaker :</strong>the object that keeps track of multiple memento. Like maintaining
                    savepoints.
                </p>
            </li>

        </ol>
        <p>A Caretaker would like to perform an operation on the Originator while having the possibility to rollback.
            The caretaker calls the createMemento() method on the originator asking the originator to pass it a memento
            object. At this point the originator creates a memento object saving its internal state and passes the
            memento to the caretaker. The caretaker maintains the memento object and performs the operation. In case of
            the need to undo the operation, the caretaker calls the setMemento() method on the originator passing the
            maintained memento object. The originator would accept the memento, using it to restore its previous state.
            Let’s see an example of Memento design pattern.

        <p><em>Code Example</em></p>
        <p><a href="ex1.html" target="_blank">undo.cpp</a></p>
        <p><em>Common Usage</em></p>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>A snapshot of (some portion of) an object’s state must be saved so that it can be restored to
                        that state later.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A direct interface to obtaining the state would expose implementation details and break the
                        object’s encapsulation.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The memento design pattern is clearly heavily used in any IDEs, as can be seen when you
                        constantly use CTRL+ Z, to undo mistakes you have made either intentionally or unintentionally
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> The Memento pattern lets you make full copies of an object’s state, including private fields,
                        and store them separately from the object. While most people remember this pattern thanks to the
                        “undo” use case, it’s also indispensable when dealing with transactions (i.e., if you need to
                        roll back an operation on error).


                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p><em>Code Problem</em></p>
        <p>In this example, the Task class represents a task in a task management application. The TaskManager class is responsible for managing tasks and their history using the Memento pattern. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed or uncompleted, save their state, and perform undo operations.

            This example demonstrates how the Memento pattern can be applied to implement undo and redo functionality in a task management application, allowing users to revert to previous task states.</p>
